## 🆕 RECENTLY SHIPPED (one line each; full detail in project_j_roadmap_archive.md)
- 2026-07-05 Otto PR data (conditional injection): Otto can now answer "what's my bench PR" with the real number. New utils/companionPRs.ts detects a PR question (generic PR words OR any of the user's own lift names/typo-tolerant) and, ONLY then, attaches the user's FULL history-backed PR list (heaviest set + est 1-rep max per lift, ghost-filtered) to that one request's data snapshot; costs nothing on unrelated messages. Otto does the fuzzy lift-name matching itself. Also attaches the user's full REAL-exercise list (live UNION of pj_exercise_library + every exercise in their programs/weekly template + PR'd lifts, re-read each message so custom / routine-quick-add / renamed exercises are always current) so Otto distinguishes a real lift with no PR yet ("Cable Press") from a made-up name ("Push Button") instead of implying it exists. KB guard updated. Deployed. Pattern to reuse for the other on-demand datasets
- 2026-07-05 Faith aesthetic pass: dropped the cream/eggshell CARD wash on the Faith tab cards (Gratitude, Bible & Plans, Prayer) + the Plans page card -> theme.bgCard so they match the rest of the app. WARM theme keeps its cream (needed so cards lift off its warm page); dark was already = bgCard (no visible change). Every amber accent stays (borders/icons/buttons/prayer boxes/verse ref). Today's Message + Faith Hub home base color untouched. Prayer page left as-is on purpose (its only cream IS the amber prayer boxes, which stay). Also removed the amber top-gradient on the Faith home card on DARK only (it muddied the top). Warm-theme + full 5-theme device audit still pending
- 2026-07-04 PR home polish: (1) ghost-PR fix: All PRs + per-lift Records now only show records backed by SURVIVING logged history, so a PR from a deleted workout no longer lingers (non-destructive display gate); (2) All-PRs card redesign to two value tiles (heaviest set / est 1-rep max) with date up in the header, tighter cards, taller scroll; same two-tile style mirrored in the detail Records section; (3) Otto route: added pr_home route key + client trigger + prompt so Otto's "where are my PRs" reply now shows a tappable pill to the All PRs list (deployed)
- 2026-07-04 PR HOME (records Piece B): Exercise Library gets a "PRs" button (top-right) opening an ALL PRs modal (per-lift heaviest set + est 1-rep max + date, sort Recent/A-Z/Z-A, tap a card into that lift); each lift's detail modal gets a "Records & History" section (records + session-by-session history, empty state when none). New utils/liftPR.liftSessionHistory + tests (26 total pass). Otto "New PR" card now deep-links here (openPRs param); Otto KB updated + deployed. Modals mirror the existing workout-library modal pattern exactly. Otto still does NOT get the user's actual PR numbers (see follow-up)
- 2026-07-04 PR wording + explainer (records #2): recap + Otto card reworded ("New heaviest set: 140 lb × 5" / "New estimated 1-rep max: 163 lb", identical in ALL modes, Otto card now 3 clean lines); new 'personal_records' tooltipRegistry entry (auto-lands in glossary) + (i) on the recap trophy card; Otto KB taught PRs/1-rep max (deployed). New standing rule in CLAUDE.md: every behavior change updates Otto's KB too
- 2026-07-04 PR revoke + honesty (records follow-up #1): PRs now DERIVE from logged history (new pure engine utils/liftPR.ts, 21 unit tests) instead of ratcheting-and-sticking, so unchecking/editing/deleting a set (or deleting the exercise) recomputes the lift's best and rolls back a record it no longer earns. "up from" now shows the true prior best (not a same-session intermediate). A protected floor keeps records with no surviving logged history (dev seed / deleted-program PRs). "View Summary" no longer computes PRs (one writer). Device smoke-test PASSED
- 2026-07-04 Otto PR producer (records, Piece A): lift PRs now bank the moment a qualifying SET is checked (not gated behind View Summary; partial sessions count) -> real "New PR" hub card (grouped, Mindful-aware) + recap trophy reads recorded day-hits. New pj_workout_state.prHitsByDay field (additive). Dev tool: "Seed lift PR baselines". Tests 1-3 PASSED on device
- 2026-07-04 Nutrition-achievement mis-timing fix: reverted the #2 force on the NUTRITION check (calorie-goal achievements only count COMPLETED days, so a same-day log can never complete one; forcing it popped legit past-day badges mid-meal). Momentum force kept. NOTE: nutrition check always scores history vs your CURRENT calorie/pace target, so changing your weight pace reshuffles the count (by design)
- 2026-07-04 Achievement pop-on-action timing fix: momentum + nutrition checks take a force flag that skips the once/day gate; food-detail AND recipe-log pass it after a log, so a same-day threshold pops now instead of a day late (idempotent, app-open unchanged)
- 2026-07-04 Bug fixes from Adaptive Target entry point work: adaptive-target.tsx bg (theme.bg typo -> theme.bgPrimary) + missing Stack.Screen headerShown:false (was showing double/raw-filename header); black title/header text -> dimmer tokens (matches app-wide header convention); Sleep Goal wheel picker now re-syncs to the saved value on Cancel; Settings > Goals floating save bar padding no longer cut off by home-indicator curve; Otto FAB now animates up to clear any screen's floating save bar (Settings Goals + Profile) instead of sitting under/blocking it -- new utils/floatingBar.ts signal
- 2026-07-04 Adaptive Target permanent entry point: "Check My Target" row in Settings > Goals, next to Auto-Adjust toggle, pushes to /adaptive-target for a live read of current status
- 2026-07-04 Notification-hub explainers: panel (i) tooltip + full interactive tour (modal-scoped spotlight inside Otto); Adaptive TDEE glossary tooltip + (i) on the Your Target screen
- 2026-07-04 Defect F: non-wearer coaching pivot (getWearState/isLikelyWearer + Recovery-tab whole-screen empty state)
- 2026-07-04 Adaptive TDEE (wearable Phase 2): scale-based real-burn estimate + suggested calorie target, weekly-gated, suggest-by-default via Otto hub
- 2026-07-04 Otto notification hub Phase 1: badge + bell + panel, achievement + daily-goal producers
- 2026-07-03 Otto knowledge base v2 FULL (deployed); UTC->local achievement-gate fix; Apple-cardio timestamp fallback; AI-estimator mic interim toast
- 2026-07-01 Security: all direct third-party API calls moved behind Cloud Functions (Anthropic proxy + FatSecret proxy)
- 2026-06-29 HR-zone bar snap-back fix; splash-flash fix; protein-pattern card copy; water delete/edit + bar-length + goal-hit fixes (pending fresh-build verify below)
- 2026-06 (older shipped work: At a Glance makeover, empty-state audit + presence helper, wearable Phase 0/1, Today's Message overhaul, sleep-stages graph, comparison presets, reinstall auto-restore, etc.) -> see archive

## ⏭️ NEXT UP (THE single ranked work queue -- READ THIS TOP-DOWN whenever Justin asks "what's next")
Ranking IS the priority: [NOW] items are committed, do them first. Below them: active tracks, then QUICK
WINS. Items graduate UP here from the backlog sections so good ideas don't rot down there. When something
ships it leaves this list. Always offer at least one QUICK WIN when Justin asks what's next, and pull a
stale backlog item up now and then. The launch gates further down (REVERT BEFORE LAUNCH, LAUNCH BLOCKERS)
are separate pre-submission checklists, NOT part of this menu.

- [ ] Expand Otto's on-demand data access (ONE DATASET AT A TIME, same conditional-injection pattern as PRs / utils/companionPRs.ts): give Otto more of the user's real data, attached only when the message is about it (keeps it off the always-on snapshot). Candidates, roughly by value: full workout/exercise history ("how's my bench trending") · food log history ("what did I eat Tuesday") · detailed sleep history · body measurements · achievements/streak detail · journal/prayer entries (PRIVACY-sensitive, handle carefully). Do NOT build true LLM tool-use yet (Haiku too flaky + extra round-trips); revisit tool-use only if Otto grows into a full data assistant on a stronger model. Build/verify each dataset one at a time.
- [ ] [NOW] REAL VOICE DICTATION in the AI meal estimator (do before next TestFlight test-group submission): mic (ai-meal-estimator.tsx ~583) only focuses the field + a "coming soon" toast. Needs a native speech-recognition module (@react-native-voice/voice or expo-speech-recognition) + a NEW BUILD. Build it, OR hide the mic before submitting so there's no half-feature.
- [ ] FAB contrast/border (GLOBAL): FABs (Otto/Halo, Workout tab Add Exercise + Load Routine) are the same accent color as accent buttons behind them and MERGE when over them. Give every FAB a ring/border or stronger separating shadow. Still accent-colored, just separated. Justin flagged hard.
- [ ] Summaries producer (Otto hub): when a fresh weekly/monthly summary generates, drop a 'summary_ready' hub notification that deep-links to it.
- [ ] Bedtime "Worth watching" logic: status is computed on the FULL bedtime stdev (>60 min -> isGood false, sleep.tsx:789) while the modal shows a TRIMMED 10th-90th percentile range that reads tighter -> looks contradictory; a single late night trips it. Decide the fix (align status to the displayed range / raise threshold / require 2+ off-nights / surface the stdev). Discussion first.
- [ ] QUICK WINS (small, grab-when-convenient): notification modal solo (non-stacked) cards get shadows · animate Otto chat bubbles for some life · EvR saved-reports history list getting long -> consolidate/collapse/archive · Day Summaries grouped by week is 9 weeks and growing -> after N weeks group Month -> Week (open to other ideas).

---

## 🚨🚨🚨 REVERT BEFORE APP STORE LAUNCH 🚨🚨🚨 (TESTFLIGHT-ONLY HACKS - DO NOT SHIP)
Temporary for Justin's TestFlight testing (added 2026-06-24). EVERY ONE must be undone/replaced before a public release. Check this list at EVERY launch-prep session.
1. [RESOLVED IN CODE 2026-07-01] Anthropic API key was bundled client-side; now routed through the aiProxy Cloud Function (key server-side only, client grep clean). TWO TAILS STILL OPEN: (a) client change reaches testers only on the NEXT TestFlight build; (b) the previously-exposed key must be ROTATED (regenerate + revoke) after testers are on the new build, before public launch.
2. ⚠️ devProUnlocked = FREE UNLIMITED PRO. Settings dev toggle grants Pro with no payment. Before launch: gate Pro on a real subscription (RevenueCat/StoreKit) and REMOVE the override + toggle.
3. ⚠️ AI ESTIMATOR QUOTA RAISED. PRO_LIMIT bumped to effectively unlimited (services/aiMealEstimator.ts). Before launch: restore real caps.
4. ⚠️ BETA CAPS RAISED (2026-07-01). Otto FREE_DAILY_CAP 10->100/day; Halo 5->50/day; AI Meal Estimator FREE_LIMIT 3->100/month. All marked with loud BETA HACK comments. Before launch: revert to 10 / 5 / 3 (or final caps).

---

## 🚧 LAUNCH BLOCKERS
- App name + logo -- finalize from shortlist (Prevail, Steadfast, Worthy, Haven, Witness, Sown). Verify App Store + TikTok handle availability. Prevail is strongest.
- App Store Connect setup -- privacy label, age rating, URLs, description, screenshots, review notes. No code. Do after name is locked.
- Verification scan -- production build, device install, all flows confirmed before submitting.
- Anthropic account spend limit -- hard monthly spend cap in the console so AI cost can never run away (the final "sleep at night" switch on top of per-user daily caps).
- [RESOLVED IN CODE + DEVICE-VERIFIED 2026-07-01] Security #6: move ALL direct third-party API calls behind Cloud Functions. DONE (Anthropic + FatSecret). Same two tails as REVERT #1 (next build + key rotation).

---

## 🔎 POST-TRIP / PENDING FRESH-BUILD VERIFY
- [ ] WATER ENTRY DELETE/EDIT (data-loss fix): confirm deleting/editing a water entry no longer drops other entries. Fixed to re-read + reconcile storage and remove/edit only the targeted entry by timestamp. ⚠️ still live in the trip build until rebuilt.
- [ ] WATER BAR LENGTH: confirm the Home water bar fills correctly on cold launch (was stuck short every kill+reopen; fixed with a live pctRef).
- [ ] WATER GOAL ACHIEVEMENT: confirm hitting the water goal pops the trophy + marks the daily-goals counter today. Also watch whether daily-goal TOASTS actually pop for steps/active/exercise (suspected batch/no-pop).
- [ ] DAILY GOAL ACHIEVEMENTS: warm-app skip/batch still open (needs a goal-hit to verify; wrong-date fixed 2026-06-29). See archive for the 3-part breakdown.
- [ ] FIBER LABEL: EvR "food quality" card now reads "FIBER AVG/DAY" -- confirm.
- [ ] OPTIONAL HR ZONE BAR REDESIGN: one full-width segmented bar vs independent per-zone bars. Numbers honest either way; visual call.

---

## 📌 PARKED SMALL IDEAS (do when convenient)
- [ ] [NEEDS DESIGN] Goal-hit does NOT reverse when you delete the entry that crossed the goal (e.g. quick-add water over goal, then delete it -> still shows "achieved today"). Cosmetic (no data loss) BUT reversing is thorny: crossing a goal increments a LIFETIME count feeding goal achievements + streaks, so un-crossing means decrementing + possibly re-locking an achievement (fights "achievements never revoke"). Do NOT bolt on a naive reversal.
- [ ] Achievement "pop on the action" timing: action-earned achievements don't pop until next app-open (per-category check gated once/day, runs on open before the action). Fix: run the check right after the qualifying action + let a same-day action bypass the once/day gate. BEST DONE with the notification-hub work.
- [ ] "Manage in Settings" button in the in-app Health section: Linking.openSettings() hotlink to iOS Settings for Apple Health permissions (App-Store-safe path).
- [ ] "View all achievements" button in the Stats Records or Streaks section (trophy icon in the header is buried).

## ⭐ HIGH-PRIORITY OPEN (bigger tracks)
- [HIGH] Onboarding full pass -- functionality sweep AND apply the new gradient/aesthetic treatment across all onboarding screens. Dedicated session. app/onboarding/*.
- [HIGH] PR tracking + lifting stats -- log PRs per lift, 1RM trend as graphable stat, surface in EvR, volume per muscle group. Required before workout-achievement PRs. Full spec: SPEC_lifting_log.md. (Basic PR detection ships with the core log's Finish summary; this is the richer analytics layer.)
- [HIGH] Recovery home card -- Sleep card exists, no Recovery presence. Two-face linked tile (Sleep/Recovery) that auto-cycles. Spec: SPEC_sleep.md §12 (design NOT locked). Build AFTER Recovery-tab polish.
- [HIGH] Metric drill-down system -- tap any metric -> focused drill-down (7/30d mini-graph + what-it-is/how-calculated/what-it-affects/how-to-improve). One shared component + per-metric registry, both tabs. Spec: SPEC_sleep.md §13 (decisions locked 2026-06-14). Recovery first.
- [HIGH] Card top accent gradient wash -- adopt app-wide, replacing left-accent-border style. Reference impl shipped on the 4 Recovery-tab cards. Full strict spec: SPEC_card_gradient.md. REMAINING: build shared GradientCard.tsx, swap ~20 screens, shadow tuning on first TestFlight, 5-theme audit.
- [HIGH] Tutorial + tooltip full audit -- in progress, tab by tab (batches of 3, device-tested each). REMAINING: spotlight lag (TestFlight verify), hidden-card guard, Log Today's Total interactive tutorial, tooltip audit + wording passes, flag every card missing a (i). data/tutorials.ts + tooltipRegistry.ts.

## 🗂️ OPEN BACKLOG BY AREA (open/future only; shipped history is in the archive)

### Onboarding
- Mindful onboarding -- encouragement language + Mindful-specific Screen 4 copy (graph/presets already gated off). Copy pass.
- Macro presets -- Screen 4, Discipline/Balanced only. Also settable in Settings.
- Progress bar on onboarding screens -- segmented step indicator, screens 2-7.
- Apple Health home banner for skippers -- one-time dismissable banner (pairs with the openSettings hotlink above).
- Weight projection graph -- profile page version (onboarding version built; profile.tsx not).
- Daily Intention card for Not Right Now users -- Today's Message morphs for NRN. Low priority.

### Home / UX
- Primary button audit -- all primary CTAs to full accent fill; transparent bordered = secondary only.
- Day detail BMR row -- add estimated BMR to the calorie breakdown (Consumed/Burned/Net).
- Exclusions polish -- first-use callout on calendar dot; help article; excluded-list view (view + un-exclude); three entry points.
- Day Summary card enhancements -- configurable surface time, earlier-access home card option, richer multi-day context. Design session first.
- Day Summaries archive layout -- collapsible rows may get clunky at volume. Revisit at 8+ weeks history.
- Greeting area customization -- settings picker for the top-left home header slot. Design session first.
- Physical measurements in profile -- waist/neck/hip (enables Navy body-fat estimate).
- HealthKit permissions audit -- review requested vs available data types; add high-value metrics before next build.
- Loading + error states audit -- sweep all screens for flashy load behavior + silent failures.

### Food & Log
- Big 3 macro presets -- quick protein/carb/fat picker from the macro gear icon and/or Settings.
- %DV entry in Create Food -- bidirectional amount/%DV fields. Full spec: SPEC_nutrition.md.
- Food search fuzzy matching -- local results use exact substring only; add fuzzy/Levenshtein. add-food.tsx.
- UNSET button on food detail -- unset a barcode-linked food without visiting Set Foods. Needs barcode route context.
- SET banner tip -- "(i) Tap SET on the correct item" after a barcode scan. On the fence.
- Calorie target transparency -- (i) tooltip explaining how the recommendation is calculated (BMR/lifestyle/pace). settings.tsx.

### Workout
- Load routine modal polish -- editable/deletable presets are a bigger dedicated-session item.
- Workout tab muscle group breakdown -- aggregated session-level summary (MuscleMap is per-exercise only).
- Daily exercise + active-calorie goal progress display -- goals settable + celebration fires, but no home progress display. Design decision: Fitness Metrics card vs Activity Rings vs under Steps.
- Onboarding-to-home transition -- guided first steps post-onboarding, no cold drop-off. Planning session.

### Stats & Reports
- Comparison + calendar CPP polish pass -- confirmed-needed ("hideous, very cheaply done"). All 4 presets + day-vs-day work.
- Fitness Metrics as graphable keys -- VO2 Max, Resting HR, Resp Rate, Blood O2, Body Fat. Infra exists; add to registry + fetchTrendData.
- Trend indicators -- Apple-style up/down arrow on graph values / At a Glance vs prior period.
- EvR refinement pass -- correlations need to be genuinely smart. Hard to test without data. Revisit with Smart Tips.

### Faith
- Today's Message overhaul -- CORE COMPLETE 2026-06-23. Remaining: 5-theme audit + the next-up Bible tutorial.
- Cycling Bible verses -- fine-print on Log + Workout tabs. Rooted on / Exploring optional / NRN hidden.
- Plans hub browsing -- category grouping, filter chips, search. app/plans.tsx.
- Bundle full KJV offline -- today fetches from GitHub (breaks offline); bundle ~4MB. data/bible-web.ts.
- Achievement toast remaining -- trigger context under achievement name; wording update before launch.
- Bible translation selector -- picker in the Bible gear modal. KJV only today.
- Faith AI verse-banner share tap-through -- tapping outside the share sheet highlights a random verse. Cosmetic.
- Challenges/Missions layer -- full spec in SMART_COACH_SPEC.md. Parked behind the Faith AI track.
- Donate/Support button -- post-TestFlight. StoreKit tip jar or Ko-fi. Not urgent.

### Sleep & Recovery
- Wire Recovery Score into weekly/monthly summaries, Day Summary, Stats, dayScore.ts. Detail in SPEC_recovery_coach.md.
- Sleep score stage-weight tuning -- bump REM weight, soften deep-sleep penalty (currently equal at 30pts). utils/sleepScore.ts.
- (note) Hypnogram connector lines CUT PERMANENTLY -- too sloppy when transitions are dense; no clean solution.

### Coaching & AI
- Voice (anti-eggshell) standard -- confident + direct, not hedging; encouragement that feels earned. Already fixed in Smart Coach + Halo; hold the line everywhere.
- Smart AI extra nutrients -- decision needed: do sodium/vitamins/micros feed Smart AI tips or stay display-only? Showing values fine; PRESCRIPTIVE advice = medical/legal risk. Discuss before build.
- Caffeine tracking -- daily total, high-amount warnings, first-use disclaimer. Design decisions needed. Duty-of-care item.
- Food group pattern detection -- zero whole foods X days -> gentle mode-aware tip.

### Streaks
- Burn accuracy freeze -- freeze burnAccuracyPct per-day (like goalSnapshot) so changing it doesn't retroactively shift streaks. utils/goalHit.ts / stats.tsx.
- Streak grace day system -- mode-aware grace days (Discipline cap 1 / Balanced cap 3 / Mindful none).
- Streak end warning visuals -- card color shift to orange/red within X hours of midnight, action not done.
- Edit Streak Count -- manual override with disclaimer. Design session first.

### Vacation Mode & Exclusions (ONE design knot -- Justin 2026-06-22; decide exclusion behavior FIRST, then build Vacation Mode)
- [AUDIT NEEDED] Exclusion / Vacation Mode source-of-truth convergence (FULL APP). Confirm every feature that reads daily data routes through the SAME exclusion/vacation check (Day Score, EvR, summaries, streaks, stats...).
- [SPEC DRAFTING] Vacation Mode -- one toggle auto-excludes nutrition/water/weight/sleep while still passively capturing HealthKit data; duration in days, auto-off on expiry. Spec: SPEC_vacation_mode.md.
- Snooze notifications option -- snooze/defer a notification; may pair with Vacation Mode.

### Tutorials & Tooltips
- Tooltip audit pass -- sweep all cards, flag every card missing a (i), build the missing ones. (See also the HIGH audit item above.)

### Animations
- Number transitions -- AnimatedNumber shipped on Home + Log. Remaining: stats tab values, workout tab reps/sets.
- Progress bar/ring/donut animation audit -- calorie bar on load, macro bars on entry, food donut on load, water bar bounce, sleep donut on load.
- Goal-moment animations -- water goal (fill + pulse), step goal (flip green), calorie goal (color transition).

### Settings & Modes
- Settings/Help: Coaching Style + Faith Journey in-depth explainers (quick blurb from the row + full article). UI approach TBD.
- Style/mode audit -- features that shouldn't show in Mindful, Discipline-only features, wrong defaults. Dedicated session.
- Mindful mode full app-wide audit -- inconsistent implementation across every screen/card/copy string. Dedicated session.
- Goals sub-category accordion polish -- FITNESS/NUTRITION GOALS sub-sections collapsible. settings.tsx.
- Resources and wellness links -- curated Settings > Help section (books, channels). Mostly static.
- "You've grown" coach message -- after key thresholds; mode-aware; ties to faith-journey prompts. Design first.

### Journal
- Date on journal entries tappable -- routes to that day's Day Detail.
- Search within journal entries -- low priority.
- Long-text stress test -- verify 500-word entries format correctly. QA.
- Multiple entries same day -- verify prayer + gratitude same day display correctly. QA.

### Notifications (system push -- SPEC_notifications.md is source of truth; separate from the in-app Otto hub)
- Notifications spec build -- 14 types, copy pools, deep linking all specced. Dedicated session.
- Notification center -- bell icon in profile header, badge, real-time toasts for Health sync events.
- Daily summary push notification -- push version of the morning Day Summary. NOT in the 14-type spec yet; add before building.

### Visual Polish
- Full theme audit -- all 5 themes x all accents, every screen, before beta. Dedicated testing session.
- Progress bar track color pass -- across all themes.
- Empty state illustrations -- SVG illustrations replacing icon+text empties. Theme-aware, app-wide.
- MFP switcher experience -- first-impression UX for power users arriving from MyFitnessPal.
- Sign-in logo entrance animation -- logo pops instead of fading. Verify on TestFlight first.

### Infrastructure
- Firestore migration -- move primary data from AsyncStorage to Firestore (auth already done). Big item.
- State restoration on launch -- save active tab + scroll position, restore on cold launch.
- HealthKit source detection -- show "via Garmin/Whoop/Oura" labels on sleep/HRV data.
- Offline-first behavior.
- In-app review prompt -- prompt to rate at the right moment.
- Accessibility -- respect system Dynamic Type font sizes.
- Tooltip pulse visibility awareness -- only pulse when the card is visible in the ScrollView viewport. Not blocking.
